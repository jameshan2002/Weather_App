# Weather_App
 <Creating a weather app using API>
 
 - [Check Demo](https://jameshan2002.github.io/Weather_App/)
 
 What is used
 - Vanilla JS
 - OpenWeatherMap API
 - Webpack
 - npm
 
 Learned how to use .fetch and promises to connect API and display in on a website.
 
 Used "async" and "await" for API to be searched and wait until the .json data is retrived.
